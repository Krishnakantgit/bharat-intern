Welcome to the "SMS Spam Detector" project! This machine learning model identifies whether a given SMS is spam or not, providing a valuable tool for spam detection and filtering.

About This Project
The "SMS Spam Detector" utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification to determine whether an SMS is spam or not. The project is deployed as a web app using Streamlit, hosted on the Streamlit cloud platform for easy access.


Features - 
SMS Spam Detection: Detects whether an SMS is spam or not, helping users filter out unwanted messages.

Naive Bayes Algorithm: Utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm, well-suited for text classification tasks.

User-Friendly Interface: The web app is powered by Streamlit, offering an intuitive and interactive user experience.

Cloud Deployment: Hosted on the Streamlit platform, making it easily accessible to users.

Technologies Used
This project leverages the following technologies:

1.Python: The primary programming language for building and deploying the SMS spam detection model.
2.Naive Bayes Algorithm: The machine learning algorithm used for text classification.
3.Streamlit: The web framework used to create the user-friendly interface.

Usage
